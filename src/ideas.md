- `Without bashing other languages, how it compares to others - syntax / performance / memory usage / ...`
- `Target(s) - Web / Mac / Windows / Linux / IoT stuff / ...`
- `I also like the way the Rust book works with like indicators of "this code won't compile so don't even try to run it" for example`
